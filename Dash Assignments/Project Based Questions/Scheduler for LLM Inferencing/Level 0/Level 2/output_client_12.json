  "Prompt": "What is Federated Learning?",
  "Message": "{\n\"Federated Learning\": \"Federated Learning is a machine learning approach that allows for decentralized data analysis. In Federated Learning, a model is trained across multiple devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging the data itself. Instead, the devices or servers communicate only the updates made to the model based on their local data, which are then aggregated to update a global model. This approach enables the development of machine learning models that can learn from large and diverse data sets, while preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead.\"}",
