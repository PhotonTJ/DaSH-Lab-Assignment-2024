  "Message": "{\n\"layers\": [\n{\"layer1\": \"Physical Layer\"},\n{\"layer2\": \"Data Link Layer\"},\n{\"layer3\": \"Network Layer\"},\n{\"layer4\": \"Transport Layer\"},\n{\"layer5\": \"Session Layer\"},\n{\"layer6\": \"Presentation Layer\"},\n{\"layer7\": \"Application Layer\"}\n]\n}\n\nThe OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used for understanding and describing how different network protocols interact and work together to provide network services. The model has seven layers:\n\n1. Physical Layer: This layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data over a physical medium. It deals with the mechanical, electrical, functional, and procedural characteristics to access the physical medium.\n2. Data Link Layer: This layer is responsible for node-to-node data transfer. It packages raw bits into frames, handles error detection and correction, and controls the flow of data.\n3. Network Layer: This layer is responsible for the delivery of individual packets from the source host to the destination host. It handles logical addressing, routing, and packet sequencing.\n4. Transport Layer: This layer is responsible for end-to-end message delivery. It provides mechanisms for connection-oriented communication, reliability, flow control, and multiplexing.\n5. Session Layer: This layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections between applications. It coordinates sessions, provides dialog control, and synchronizes data exchange.\n6. Presentation Layer: This layer is responsible for translation, compression, and encryption of data. It ensures the syntax and semantics of the data are preserved.\n7. Application Layer: This layer is responsible for network services to applications. It provides services such as email, file transfer, and virtual terminals.",
