  "Prompt": "What is Docker?",
  "Message": "{\n\"Definition\": \"Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containers.\" }\n\nDocker provides a way to package and deploy applications in a lightweight, portable container that can run consistently across different platforms and environments. This helps to reduce conflicts and dependencies between applications and their underlying infrastructure, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy software. Docker containers share the host system's kernel, but run in an isolated environment, which makes them more efficient and lightweight than traditional virtual machines. Additionally, Docker provides a number of tools and services for managing and orchestrating containers, including Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Docker Compose.",
