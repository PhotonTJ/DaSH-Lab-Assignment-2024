  "Message": "{\n\"OSI Model\": \"The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe how different network protocols interact and work together to provide network services. The model has seven layers, each of which is responsible for a specific aspect of communication between devices on a network.\" }\n\nThe seven layers of the OSI model are as follows:\n\n1. Physical Layer: This layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium. It defines the electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications for the physical medium and the devices that connect to it.\n2. Data Link Layer: This layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data frames between devices on the same physical network. It provides error detection and correction, as well as flow control and access control to the network medium.\n3. Network Layer: This layer is responsible for the routing of data packets between different networks. It provides logical addressing, routing, and congestion control.\n4. Transport Layer: This layer is responsible for the end-to-end delivery of data between applications running on different devices. It provides segmentation and reassembly, flow control, and error recovery.\n5. Session Layer: This layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating sessions between applications. It provides dialogue control and synchronization.\n6. Presentation Layer: This layer is responsible for the translation and formatting of data for the application layer. It provides data compression, encryption, and decryption.\n7. Application Layer: This layer is responsible for providing network services to applications. It provides access to network services, such as email, file transfer, and remote login.",
