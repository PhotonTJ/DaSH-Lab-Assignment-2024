  "Prompt": "What is a GPU and how is it different from a CPU?",
  "Message": "{\n\"GPU\": {\n\"Definition\": \"A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display.\",\n\"Difference from CPU\": {\n\"Function\": \"While a CPU (Central Processing Unit) is designed to handle a wide range of tasks and is optimized for sequential serial processing, a GPU is specialized for and optimized for parallel processing.\",\n\"Performance\": \"A GPU can handle many tasks simultaneously, making it ideal for processes that can be broken down into many smaller ones, such as rendering graphics, scientific calculations, and data analysis. This allows a GPU to perform certain tasks significantly faster than a CPU.\"\n}\n}\n}\n\nNote: This is a simplified explanation and there are many more technical details that could be added to both the definition of a GPU and the differences between a GPU and a CPU.",
